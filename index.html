      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a Petroleum Engineer by trade, but I'm switching careers to software
        developer. I'm going to learn software development techniques through a 
        coding boot camp. The boot camp is offered through Rice University in 
        Houston, TX in conjunction with Trilogy Education Services.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Sugar Land, Texas</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Following various college and professional sports. Namely, Texas Longhorn
        athletics and motorcylce gp. Reading crime/thriller fiction novels. One of
        my favorite authors is Michael Connelly. Lastly, programming, of course. 
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>One cannot dream when they are still figuring out what is 
        possible in this new field of interest. 
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Houston, Texas</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>It combines my best skills of being creative and solving problems.
        Furthermore, I enjoy the sense of being in a state of 'flow' that 
        programming yields.
